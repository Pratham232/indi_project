P0-TRAINER-FEEDBACK-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM.

This is a project to provide the rating for the trainer based on his/her batch and according to question section.
My module is Question Management from the entire project. In this module you can log in as an admin only and have the functionality to add a question into the database and list them.
I've implemented all the user stories mentioned into the common backlog.
Such as, as admin I should be able to add questions into my database, question section should be enum, Etc.
